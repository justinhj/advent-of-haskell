# Zig notes

This was written by me and a comvination of Claude, Bing Copilot, Deepseek and ChatGPT.
None of us are great at Zig. Also Zig 0.13.0 is not well covered in the models.

Built with `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast` it runs in about 3.5 seconds compared with 10 seconds for the Haskell version.

Both running Macbook Pro 2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9.

Not sure if I have optimization enabled on the Haskell version.
